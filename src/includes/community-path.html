					<h3>Community Path</h3> 
					<p>For this project, my goal was to use my design skills to transform a one-page site from a cluttered 1990s style, to an easy to read modern look - while re-using as much of the original content and colors as possible. For an extra challenge, I set a one-day deadline for myself - for both the design and development.</p>
